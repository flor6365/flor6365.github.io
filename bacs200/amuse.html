    <h2>Amusement #1</h2>
    <p>Everyone says Disney World is the most magical place on earth. After my trip in December 2021, I would have to agree with them!</p>
      <p>I always pictured disney world to be a place for kids only, kind of like a childrens amusement park. However, i was dead wrong! Disney World is a place of amusement for people of all ages!<br> If you haven't had the opportunity to go, I recommend you to go sometime soon! You definitely won't regret paying th emoney to get there and experience the <strong>magic</strong> </p>
      <p>Below is a link to the Disney World website to allow you to start planning your <em>Magical Experience</em> for the whole family!</p>

    <h2>Amusment #2</h2>
      <p> In Disney World there are four (4) parks you can visit! They are as follows;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Magic Kingdom</em>, this is the main park and is probably the best one that you will get the biggest bang for your buck. </li>
      <li><em>EPCOT - Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow</em>, in this park you will get to experience many different countries such as England, Canada, China, Japan, Moracco, Norway, France, etc.<br> Here you will be able to experience different cultures, merch, food and beverages. It may not sound like much, but it still adds to the magical experience that you should definitely try.</li>
      <li><em>Hollywood Studios</em> - This park is a personal favorite, because it has my favorite attract, <strong>Galaxies Edge</strong>. Which is <em>Star Wars</em> themed, when you step into this part of the park you feel like you stepped straight into a movie, and you're in this fun immersive experience. I definitely turned into a kid, no doubt about it.</li>
      <li>And the last park is <em>Animal Kingdom</em>, this is a great park to use as a last day experience, because it's definitely a leisure park, while there is still tons to do here. It is definitely more relaxed than the others, not as fast paced.<br> At this park you have Pandora (from the James Cameron directed movie AVATAR), Safari tour, and so much more.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Amusement #3</h2>
      <p>If you get the chance to experience these parks, make sure you stay till the end of the day, because each park has an end of day Light show or fireworks show that'll move you through so  many emotions, you'll be shocked and/or stunned from it all.<br> to make sure you have the best view of the displays, make sure you are standing in the main walk ways that are viewing either the <em>Magic Kingdom Castle, EPCOT Ball/Globe, Hollywood Studios Chinese Theater, and Animal Kingdoms Tree of Life.</em></p>

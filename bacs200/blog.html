				<h1>&lt;Cryptocurrency&gt;</h1>
				<p>&lt;Today we see many different types of Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, DOGE Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and the list goes on. The issue with cryptocurrency is that people are starting to use it as a form of payment. For example Venmo is a current carrier who is making cryptocurrency almost like cash or gold. The issue with that is that is that it is not tangible and therefore it makes it hard for everyone to buy into it.&gt;</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;Any establishment with few or no social implications is highly likely to go on a downward trend. Through Ripple for Good initiative, a social impact program whose goal is to support organizations and initiatives with a mission, an impact is recognizable. This initiative also supports education and financial literacy since they are vital in the leveraging of the global digital economy. Ripple has so far donated more than $80 million to spur education in universities through research and innovation. Back in June, Ripple launched the University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI).&gt;</p>

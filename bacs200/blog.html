				<h1>&lt;Cryptocurrency&gt;</h1>
				<p>&lt;Today we see many different types of Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, DOGE Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and the list goes on. The issue with cryptocurrency is that people are starting to use it as a form of payment. For example Venmo is a current carrier who is making cryptocurrency almost like cash or gold. The issue with that is that is that it is not tangible and therefore it makes it hard for everyone to buy into it.&gt;</p>

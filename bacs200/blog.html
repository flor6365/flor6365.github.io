				<h1>&lt;Cryptocurrency&gt;</h1>
				<p>&lt;Today we see many different types of Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, DOGE Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and the list goes on. The issue with cryptocurrency is that people are starting to use it as a form of payment. For example Venmo is a current carrier who is making cryptocurrency almost like cash or gold. The issue with that is that is that it is not tangible and therefore it makes it hard for everyone to buy into it.&gt;</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;Any establishment with few or no social implications is highly likely to go on a downward trend. Through Ripple for Good initiative, a social impact program whose goal is to support organizations and initiatives with a mission, an impact is recognizable. This initiative also supports education and financial literacy since they are vital in the leveraging of the global digital economy. Ripple has so far donated more than $80 million to spur education in universities through research and innovation. Back in June, Ripple launched the University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI).&gt;</p>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;Ripple is the third largest cryptocurrency in the world and also the most popular cryptocurrency in Asia. It will have a significant impact in Asian countries like Singapore and Russia before expanding to other countries. Additionally, countries with economies hard hit by global factors such as inflation have had a massive uptake of the Ripple cryptocurrency. For instance, in a country like Zimbabwe,  XRP is in demand throughout the nation as it tries to get back its economic prowess. On the other hand, regulatory issues are a significant factor for Ripple. For example, after the introduction of regulatory measures in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific countries, rates rose significantly. Furthermore, Ripple, and other cryptocurrencies on the market, could ultimately land you to jail in some countries such Bangladesh  where crypto-related activities are illegal. This, in turn, puts pressure on the Ripple market. Through xRapid, Ripple provides countries with a better alternative when sending money over international borders compared to traditional means. The largest payment network allows faster settlements of ledgers and connects financial institutions around the world. This effect enables trade between two countries to be lower down and more efficient.&gt;</p>

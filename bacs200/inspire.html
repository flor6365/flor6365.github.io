      <p>Jeff Bezos, inspires me because his constant innovation and business model is not one to be messed with. I aspire to be as successful as Jeff Bezos for the fact that he showed me you don't have to come from money to be successful. This man started his business as an online book store shipping orders out of his garage. He showed me that if you have a dream or a vision, keep working hard to make it a reality.</p>
      <p>Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Never give up.</li>
        <li> Never say never.</li>
        <li> Don't let the opinion of others tell you how successful you can be.</li>
        <li> Dreams were meant for sleeping, wake up and make it a reality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In life we are given opportunites to improve our lives, whether we take it depends on the choices we make in those moments, and whether or not we are able to see those moments.</p>
